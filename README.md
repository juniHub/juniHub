I'm a computer science student who is passionate about learning new things, solving problems, building and developing web applications and mobile applications. My favourite stack is JAM stack and MERN stack.
I like the saying "Learn More, Do More and Be More". I am curious about everything. When I am interested in a new project, I will learn about it first, then test it out. If it does not work at first attemp, I will research the solutions from open sources and test it out again. I may fail many times but try not to give up. Some projects have been taking me a countless of times to be successful in the end. The goal is I can learn something new and understand something better :-)

🏫 I’m currently a Software Development student at Western Governors University (WGU).\
📚 I’m currently learning fullstack web development using React, NodeJS, ExpressJS and MongoDB.\
👩‍💻 I’m looking for a software development | web aplication development internships and jobs. \
