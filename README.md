### Hello 👋

I'm a computer science student who is passionate about learning new things, solving problems, and building web and mobile applications. My favourite stack is MERN stack.
I like the saying "Learn More, Do More and Be More". I am curious about everything and always try it out first. If it does not work at first time, I will research the solutions and try it out again. I may fail again but try to not give up. Some projects have been taking me a countless of times to be successful in the end. The goal is I can learn something new and understand something better :-)

🏫 I’m currently a Software Development student at Western Governors University (WGU).\
📚 I’m currently learning fullstack web development using React, NodeJS, ExpressJS and MongoDB.
👩‍💻 I’m looking for a software development | web aplication development internship.
